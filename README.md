# Odin Recipes

This project is part of **The Odin Project's Foundations Course** and serves as a practice exercise to apply HTML knowledge learned so far. The main goal is to build a basic recipe website to showcase the following:

- Structuring HTML files with proper boilerplate.
- Creating links between pages for easy navigation.
- Using headings, paragraphs, and lists to organize content.

## Features

- A main **index page** linking to multiple recipe pages.
- Individual recipe pages containing:
  - An image of the dish.
  - A description of the recipe.
  - An ingredients list.
  - Step-by-step instructions.
- Links for seamless navigation between pages.
